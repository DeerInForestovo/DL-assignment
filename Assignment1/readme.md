Here is the instruction on how to run my code.

1. **Python environment:** Python 3 with common deep learning libraries (numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, ...)
2. **Part 1:**
   + Task 1, 3, 4 are in ```Part_1/Part_1.ipynb```
   + Task 2 is in ```Part_1/perceptron.py```
3. **Part 2:**
   + Task 1 is in ```Part_2/mlp_numpy.py``` and ```Part_2/modules.py```
   + Task 2 is in ```Part_2/train_mlp_numpy.py```, run command: ```python train_mlp_numpy.py --dnn_hidden_units 20 --learning_rate 0.01 --max_steps 1500 --eval_freq 10```
   + Task 3 is in ```Part_2/Part_2.ipynb```
4. **Part 3:**
   + Task 1 is in ```Part_2/train_mlp_numpy.py```
   + Task 2 is in ```Part_2/Part_3.ipynb```
5. Python files without a run command are modules that are not expected to be run independently, and the results of the ipynb files shows their (python files') correctness.
